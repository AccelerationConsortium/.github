## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

🙋‍♀️ The Acceleration Consortium (AC) at the University of Toronto (https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/) is a global community of academia, government, and industry members. Its purpose is to accelerate the design and discovery of a wide range of new materials and molecules, from renewable energy and consumer electronics to drugs. Using self-driving laboratories (SDLs), the AC leverages the power of artificial intelligence, robotics, engineering, and chemistry to dramatically reduce the time and cost of bringing these advanced materials to market—from an average of 20 years and $100 million to as little as one year and $1 million. In 2023, the AC was awarded a $200-million grant by Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF) to support the development of SDLs.

## Code Overview

> NOTE: We are in the process of centralizing software from several lab-specific organizations (SDLs [3](https://github.com/AC-MedChem-SDL), [5](https://github.com/AC-Formulations-SDL), [6](https://github.com/AC-SDL6), [7-Hein](https://gitlab.com/heingroup), [ac-rad](https://github.com/ac-rad)) to here.

This GitHub organization hosts the software developed at the Acceleration Consortium and includes device drivers, ML toolkits, SDL infrastructure tools, and training materials across a wide variety of disciplines, and for each of our laboratories.

### How can I find repositories for a specific SDL?

You can use [custom properties](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization) to search and filter for repositories associated with specific SDLs. Note that we use a "multi-select" custom property, so a single repo may be associated with multiple laboratories. To quickly search within each of these properties, see the following links:

| Lab Code | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [`ac-general`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Aac-general+sort%3Astars) | 🌐 General-purpose tools and resources |
| [`sdl-dev`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl-dev+sort%3Astars) | 💡 Training and Development Lab |
| [`sdl0`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl0+sort%3Astars) | 🤖 AI and Automation |
| [`sdl1`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl1+sort%3Astars) | ⚛️ Inorganic |
| [`sdl2`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl2+sort%3Astars) | ⌬ Organic small molecules |
| [`sdl3`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl3+sort%3Astars) | 💊 Medicinal chemistry |
| [`sdl4`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl4+sort%3Astars) | 🪢 Polymers |
| [`sdl5`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl5+sort%3Astars) | 💧 Formulations |
| [`sdl6`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl6+sort%3Astars) | 🫀 Human organ mimicry |
| [`sdl7-hein`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl7-hein+sort%3Astars) | 📈 Scale-up |
| [`sdl7-berlinguette`](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl7-berlinguette+sort%3Astars) | 📈 Scale-up |

You can also search for multiple criteria: e.g., repos with [both `ac-general` and `sdl-dev` property values](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Aac-general+props.lab-designation%3Asdl-dev+sort%3Astars).

More information about each lab is available on the [AC's facilities webpage](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/facilities).

## Getting Started

If you're just starting out in the self-driving lab space, consider having a look at our [community-curated list of "awesome" self-driving lab resources](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/awesome-self-driving-labs), [community forum](https://accelerated-discovery.org), and [microcourse program](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io).

TODO: Once we have more teams set up (including deciding whether e.g., sdl0 would have ac-staff as a parent team), we can link to those as well. Maybe have `[repos] [team]` within the bulleted list or similar
