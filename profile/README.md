## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

🙋‍♀️ The Acceleration Consortium (AC) at the University of Toronto is a global community of academia, government, and industry members. Its purpose is to accelerate the design and discovery of a wide range of new materials and molecules, from renewable energy and consumer electronics to drugs. Using self-driving laboratories (SDLs), the AC leverages the power of artificial intelligence, robotics, engineering, and chemistry to dramatically reduce the time and cost of bringing these advanced materials to market—from an average of 20 years and $100 million to as little as one year and $1 million. Recently, the AC was awarded a $200-million grant by Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF) to support the development of SDLs.
