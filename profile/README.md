## Hi there üëã

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The Acceleration Consortium (AC) at the University of Toronto (https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/) is a global community of academia, government, and industry members. Its purpose is to accelerate the design and discovery of a wide range of new materials and molecules, from renewable energy and consumer electronics to drugs. Using self-driving laboratories (SDLs), the AC leverages the power of artificial intelligence, robotics, engineering, and chemistry to dramatically reduce the time and cost of bringing these advanced materials to market‚Äîfrom an average of 20 years and $100 million to as little as one year and $1 million. Recently, the AC was awarded a $200-million grant by Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF) to support the development of SDLs.

Here, we host 

## Code Overview
- üìù [Community-curated list of "awesome" self-driving labs](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/awesome-self-driving-labs)
- üìú [AC Microcourses](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-microcourses)
- üè¢ [AC Training Lab](https://ac-training-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## SDLs
> NOTE: We are in the process of centralizing software from several lab-specific organizations (SDLs [3](https://github.com/AC-MedChem-SDL), [5](https://github.com/AC-Formulations-SDL), [6](https://github.com/AC-SDL6), [7-Hein](https://gitlab.com/heingroup), [ac-rad](https://github.com/ac-rad)) into this centralized GitHub organization.

You can use [custom properties](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization) to search and filter for repositories associated with specific SDLs. Note that we use a "multi-select" custom property, so a single repo may be associated with multiple property values. See for example, [all repositories with the `sdl0` custom property](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Aac-general).

To quickly search within each of these properties, see the following links:
- [SDL-Dev: Training and Development Lab](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl-dev+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL0: AI and Automation](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl0+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL1: Inorganic](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl1+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL2: Organic](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl2+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL3: Medicinal chemistry](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl3+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL4: Polymers](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl4+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL5: Formulations](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl5+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL6: Human organ mimicry](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl6+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL7-Hein: Scale-up](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl7-hein+sort%3Astars)
- [SDL7-Berlinguette: Scale-up](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/repositories?q=props.lab-designation%3Asdl7-berlinguette+sort%3Astars)

<!--- TODO: Once we have more teams set up (including deciding whether e.g., sdl0 would have ac-staff as a parent team), we can link to those as well. Maybe have `[repos] [team]` within the bulleted list or similar

More information about each lab is available on the [AC's facilities webpage](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/facilities).
